In Android, LinearLayout is a common layout that arranges “component” in vertical or horizontal order, via orientation attribute. In additional, the highest “weight” component will fill up the remaining space in LinearLayout.

In this example, the highest weight is “button3”, so it will fill up the remaining space in the layout.
